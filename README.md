- 🥬 Hiya, I'm Kaylee, but you can call me Kayl (like the vegetable). My pronouns are shey/they.
- 💡 I’m interested in web/full stack development, internet of things, video games, writing and reading, science, and philosophy.
- 🗣️ I care about equal rights for all, improving accessibility for disabled folks, workplace diversity, mental health awareness, and animal rights.
- 🌱 I’m currently polishing up my capstone project and learning React.js, Git, MongoDB, and Google Maps APIs.
- 💞 I’m looking to meet others who are also students, new to coding, and/or job hunting, as well as people in any position who have words of wisdom!
- 📫 Feel free to shoot me a message at guisekayl@gmail.com or at my blog on Medium (coming soon).
