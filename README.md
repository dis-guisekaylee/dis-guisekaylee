## 📍About Me
🥬 Hiya, I'm Kaylee, but you can call me Kayl (like the vegetable). My pronouns are she/they.

💡 I’m interested in web/full stack development, internet of things, video games, writing and reading, science, and philosophy.

🗣️ I care about equal rights for all, improving accessibility for disabled folks, workplace diversity, mental health awareness, and animal rights.

🌱 I’m currently polishing up my capstone project and learning React.js, Git, MongoDB, and Google Maps APIs. I'm also working on a website/digital storefront for a hypothetical pre-owned record store.

💞 I’m looking to meet others who are also current, former, or prospective bootcamp students, new to coding, and/or those who are job hunting in the tech industry, as well as people in any position who have words of wisdom!
