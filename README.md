- 👋 Hi, I’m @dis-guisekaylee, but you can call me Kayl (like the vegetable).
- 👀 I’m interested in web/full stack development, internet of things, video games, writing and reading, astronomy, philosophy, psychology, and sociology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and Git!
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet others who are also students or new to coding and people who used to be in my position and have wisdom to share!
- 📫 How to reach me: kaylee.guise@gmail.com or at my blog on Medium (will link soon).
